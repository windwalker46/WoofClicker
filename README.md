# Woof Clicker

**Woof Clicker** is a Unity clicker game demonstrating fundamental **C#** and **game development** concepts. Players tap to earn “barks,” progress through levels, and complete random challenges. Built as part of a **CS portfolio project** to showcase skills in **Unity, C#,** and **software architecture** for mobile and web builds.

## Play the Game 🎮  

You can **play Woof Clicker directly in your browser** here:

---

## Features

- **Endless Mode** – Accumulate infinite points.
- **Race Mode** – Beat the clock to achieve a goal.
- **Random Challenges** – Mid-game events add unpredictability.
- **Power-Ups** – Freeze time, multiply taps, or defuse Chocolates.
- **Leaderboards** – Local in-game high scores.

## Technical Highlights

- **C# Scripting & OOP** – Uses multiple scripts (GameManager, UIManager, etc.) to organize logic.
- **Unity Event Handling** – Coroutines for timed events, event-driven power-ups, and challenge triggers.
- **UI Management** – Integrates **Unity UI** (TextMeshPro, Buttons) for intuitive player interaction.
- **Design Patterns** – Basic implementation of manager classes (e.g., GameManager, PowerUpManager) to separate concerns.
- **WebGL/Builds** – Includes a **WebGL build process** for browser-based distribution (ver. 6+).

## Getting Started

### Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/windwalker46/WoofClicker.git
```

### Open in Unity (version 6+ recommended).

### Press Play or build for your desired platform (PC, Mobile, or WebGL).

## WebGL Build

**The WebGL build is not included in this repository.**  
To create a WebGL build:
1. Open the project in Unity (version 6+).
2. Build for WebGL (File → Build Settings → Web).
3. Serve locally using:
Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

## Planned Ad Integration

- Previously explored bridging **C# → JavaScript** for in-game ads.
- Will likely embed ads in HTML or rely on custom ad calls in the future.
